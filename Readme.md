# Implementation of the [*Conway's Game of Life*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_game_of_life)

The implementation was done over two hours during the [*Hack Night*](http://www.meetup.com/torontoruby/) at Influitive's
office in Toronto. It's still work in progress as I'm new to Ruby, and I might have quite a lot of mistakes in the
logic of writing the code in dynamic language vs. static. More feature to come...
